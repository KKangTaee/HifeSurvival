Thank you for purchasing this tileset. Many hours, blood, sweat and teas have flown into the creation of it.

This package is part of a larger and growing collection of isometric tilesets.

About the creator:
Max Heyder Art aka. Golden Skull
I am a freelance 2D and 3D Lead Game Artist and Art Director with a decade of industrial experience and over 6 released titles.

My dream is to create affordable tilesets for game developers fulltime.
If you wish to support me, you can do so by writing a positive review with some kind words, and feel free to donate if your game ends up making a lot of money or you want to see me create more assets. :P

This Asset is compatible with and optimized for Unity's 2D Isometric Tilemaps.

The Autotile I deliver with the package require the 2D Extras to function:

**Some Sorting Issues might occur and need tweaking for best results. 
IF YOU EXPERIENCE ANY SORTING ISSUES:
Go to: EDIT > Project Settings > Graphics > Transparency Sort Mode > Custom Axis > 0 , 1 , -0.46
I try to provide fully functional flawless examples, but I might have missed something. 
Please report your findings in my discord and we look for solutions together.

This asset is compatible with my other packs. 
**Some of my older packages need an update to be setup with the new Tilemap System, until then please excuse any compatibility issues.
**The Isometric Village Tileset had been created with a different setup (square, boxy tiles) and are therefore visually compatible but might cause issues with Tilemaps among other things. An Update is planned for Summer 2021.
